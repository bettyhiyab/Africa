    <h2 style="color: cadetblue"> How the name Africa was drived from</h2>
    <p> One of the most popular suggestions for the origins of the term 'Africa' is that it is derived from the Roman name for a tribe living in the northern reaches of Tunisia, believed to possibly be the Berber people. The Romans variously named these people 'Afri', 'Afer' and 'Ifir'.Aug 27, 2019 </p>
